Optimizer code to reproduce results on [Understanding and Improving Shampoo and SOAP via Kullback-Leibler Minimization (ICLR 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03378).

We provide a prototype implementation of the [KL-Shampoo/KL-SOAP](https://github.com/yorkerlin/KL-Methods/blob/main/optim/kl_opt.py).

We are developing a faster and more robust version of KL-Shampoo/KL-SOAP. Stay tuned for new updates.
